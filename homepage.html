        <p class="aboutMe">I am 32 years old and excited to be back in North Carolina - specifically the Raleigh/Durham area.  In late 2018 I relocated from Birmingham, AL, with the intention of starting a new career in the tech industry.  After spending close to ten years in financial services field, I decided a change in career paths was necessary.  Combined with my relocation, the timing of this career transition felt perfect.  After researching various options in the area, I chose to enroll in Momentum Learning's 12-week Coding Immersive course to launch my career in web development.  Momentum Learning is a great community with strong networking ties.  After 12 weeks of hard work, I expect to be fully ready to begin a new, rewarding career in software development.
